EEC 172 – Lab 2
This project and it’s files are derived from TI’s “Hello World” program, which uses a TivaWare board to display simple messages.

We have expanded the sample program to accept an Adafruit OLED display and will soon have ability to use IR receiver to take input from a standard remote control.
